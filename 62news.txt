Thailand edges Ivory Coast, 3-2, in group game
Thanatta Chawong scored an insurance goal in the 75th minute, 
which proved the difference, and Thailand beat Ivory Coast, 3-2, 
in their Women's World Cup group game on Thursday.
Thailand improved its group record to 1-1-0 with three points while Ivory Coast, 
10-0 losers to Germany in its opener, fell to 0-2-0.

Ivory Coast opened the scoring just four minutes in. A corner kick pinballed 
in the six-yard box until Ange Nguessan was able to get her left foot on it and 
beat Thailand goalkeeper Waraporn Boonsing for a 1-0 lead.
In the 26th minute, Anootsara Maijarern took a seemingly offside long feed on the 
left wing and passed to Orathai Srimanee, who volleyed it by goalkeeper Dominique Thaimale 
to even the score.

Srimanee made it 2-1 in first half stoppage time, heading home a service from Rattikan 
Thongsombut. The ball hit the crossbar and came straight down, but review confirmed it 
completely crossed the goal line.

Josee Nahi cut the deficit to one in the 88th minute, but a tying attempt by Christine 
Lohoues in injury time hit the crossbar and deflected out of bounds.
