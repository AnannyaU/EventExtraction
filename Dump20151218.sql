The Fidesz candidate was second with 34.4 percent, followed by a challenger jointly backed by the opposition Socialist and \r\nDemokratikus Koalicio parties.\r\nThe win marks a breakthrough for Jobbik, which became the second-largest political party in Hungary after last year\'s elections. It also underscores the \r\ngrowing unpopularity of Fidesz, which lost a by-election in February that cost the ruling party its two-thirds majority in parliament. Jobbik, criticized \r\nby human rights groups for its anti-Roma, anti-Semitic, pro-Russian and anti-European Union platform, is trying to tone down its rhetoric to woo mainstream \r\nvoters to win power in 2018, party chief Gabor Vona told Magyar Nemzet newspaper last month.\r\n\'Jobbik\'s success shows that a critical mass of voters no longer view the party as radical, analysts at the Political Capital research institute in Budapest \r\nsaid in an e-mail. There\'s no limit to the party\'s growth.\r\nLast April, Orban managed to retain his two-thirds majority and Jobbik failed to capture any of the 106 districts in parliamentary elections, winning instead \r\na large share of party-list votes for its many second- and third-place finishes in districts.\r\nTide Turns\r\nSince Orban\'s re-election, Fidesz has plunged in polls as the government battled corruption allegations, faced street protests against a spate of new taxes \r\nand encountered criticism over an energy deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\r\nJobbik is managing to lure disillusioned Fidesz voters, according to a report in the April 9 edition of HVG weekly, based on a Median poll. Median found that \r\na fifth of Jobbik backers said they had voted for Fidesz last year.\r\nFidesz\'s support fell to 24 percent among eligible voters in March from 36 percent a year ago. Jobbik was second with 15 percent and the Socialist Party came \r\nthird with 11 percent, according to the poll.\r\nVoters said enough, they said no to Viktor Orban, no to Fidesz, Vona said at a victory rally in Tapolca on Sunday, according to MTI state news service.\r\nSuper-Majority\r\nIn February, Orban\'s candidate lost a by-election in the Veszprem district, which neighbors Tapolca. That district was won by an independent candidate backed \r\nby opposition parties excluding Jobbik. The loss cost Orban the super-majority on which he had relied since 2010 to pass major legislation, including a new \r\nconstitution, over the objections of the opposition.\r\nJobbik seeks to preserve its core values while adopting a measured, calm voice to attract mainstream voters, MTI reported, citing Vona. The party leader said \r\nhe would prove wrong those who think of Jobbik as an extremist, Nazi party, according to his March 28 Magyar Nemzet interview.\r\nFew of the thousands of people who took part in the annual march to remember the Holocaust in Budapest on Sunday were convinced of the makeover of Jobbik, which \r\non its website still calls for resisting Zionist Israels quest for world domination, starting debt restructuring talks, fighting the EU\'s colonial policies \r\nand forging a closer alliance with Iran, Russia and Turkey.\r\nToday, the world sees Hungary and they see Jobbik, Ronald S. Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, told participants at the Holocaust memorial event. \r\nAnd when businessmen want to invest in Hungary, they also see Jobbik and they\'re afraid to come. Jobbik hurts Hungary. Do not allow a small percentage of the \r\npopulation to destroy Hungary.\r\n','election'),(2,'TOGETHER WE\'LL MAKE GREAT BRITAIN GREATER STILL:\r\n \r\nCameron hails shock Tory outright majority as Miliband, Clegg and Farage all QUIT. \r\nSNP wins near clean-sweep of seats in Scotland\r\nFINAL RESULT: Tories 331 (up 25), Labour 232 (down 24), SNP 56 (up 50), Lib Dems 8 (down 48), Ukip 1 (down 1) \r\nDavid Cameron has secured an overall Commons majority, vowing to implement the Tory manifesto in full\r\nIn the best Conservative result for more than 20 years, Prime Minister visited the Queen to confirm his victory\r\nEd Miliband resigned with immediate effect after taking Labour to its worst result for three decades under Kinnock\r\nNigel Farage resigned as Ukip leader after failing to become an MP in Thanet South but could stage a comeback\r\nLib Dems are left with only 8 MPs, leading Nick Clegg to resign after a \'cruel and punishing\' night for his party\r\nBig political names ousted by voters include Ed Balls, Vince Cable, Ed Davey, Jo Swinson and Esther McVey\r\nNicola Sturgeon\'s SNP swept to a stunning victory across Scotland, winning all but three of Scotland\'s 59 seats  \r\n\r\nDavid Cameron today vowed to make Great Britain \'greater still\' as he set out how he will use his shock outright Tory majority to ensure the \'good life is in \r\nreach for everyone who\'s willing to work and do the right thing\'.\r\nThe Prime Minister used a statement outside Number 10 to pay tribute to both Labour\'s Ed Miliband and his former Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg who have both \r\nresigned after suffering heavy losses in one of the most unpredictable election results for a generation. \r\nThe three political leaders then emerged, barely an hour later, to stand side by side at the Cenotaph to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE Day. \r\nMr Cameron had earlier walked out the doors of Number 10 to declare he was forming a majority Tory government after routing Labour and the Lib Dems in the \r\nbiggest electoral shock in living memory.\r\nThe PM returned to Downing Street with his wife Samantha after making the short trip to Buckingham Palace for a meeting with the Queen to confirm what he \r\ndescribed as the \'sweetest victory of all\'.\r\nBig political names including Ed Balls, Vince Cable, Ed Davey, Doulgas Alexander, David Laws, Jim Murphy and Esther McVey all lost their seats as the political\r\nmap of Britain was dramatically redrawn with vast swathes of Tory blue and SNP yellow.\r\nIn an incredible night of political drama, Labour suffered a bloodbath in Scotland and failed to make any gains in England. Mr Miliband said he accepted \r\n\'absolute and total responsibility\' for the electoral disaster, and resigned with immediate effect. His deputy Harriet Harman also announced she will stand \r\naside.\r\nMr Clegg, who was left as just one of eight MPs to survive the near-destruction of the Lib Dems, also resigned - admitting he had led the party to its worst \r\never defeat.\r\nIt came after Ukip\'s Nigel Farage threw in the towel within minutes of receiving confirmation that he had lost his bid to enter Parliament. But in a surprise \r\nannouncement Mr Farage suggested he could return as party leader in the Autumn.\r\nMr Cameron said he would use the 331 MPs he will have in the Commons to implement the Tory manifesto in full, promising more apprenticeships, income tax cuts \r\nand an in-out referendum on Britain\'s membership of the EU.\r\nBut he also signaled that he would sign off a massive devolution of powers to Scotland, after Nicola Sturgeon\'s SNP stunned everyone to win 56 of 59 seats in \r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','election'),(3,'Jodi Arias sentenced to natural life in prison\r\nMichael Kiefer\r\nPHOENIX  Jodi Arias, who was convicted in 2013 for the 2008 murder of her lover, Travis Alexander,\r\n was sentenced Monday to \r\nnatural life in prison after two juries could not reach an unanimous decision on whether to\r\nsentence her to death.\r\n\r\nMonday\'\'s ruling ended one of the more dramatic and notorious murder trials in recent Arizona \r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAfter Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens announced the sentence, the victim\'\'s \r\nsister, \r\nTanisha Sorenson, shouted, \"Burn in hell!\"\r\nStephens had the option of giving Arias natural life or life in prison with the possibility of \r\nrelease after 25 years.\r\n\r\nIn Arias\'\' final plea to the judge, she acknowledged what she had done and the pain it had caused.\r\n\r\n\"I wish there was something I could do to take it back,\" she said.\r\n\r\nArias\'\' mother made a plea for a lighter sentence.\r\n\r\n\"I know that she is not the monster she is made out to be,\" Sandy Arias said.\r\n\r\nAnd Arias\'\' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, asked that the judge \"not base this on what a mob on \r\nsocial media says.\"\r\n\r\nWillmott said Arias is \"repulsed by what she did, she really is.\r\n\r\n\"If she cries, people call them fake tears, if she doesn\'\'t cry they say she\'\'s evil,\" the \r\ndefense attorney added.\r\nAlexander\'\'s family spoke earlier in the hearing. Sorenson said to Arias: \"Stop murdering my \r\nbrother again and \r\nagain by smearing his name.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of his sisters, Hillary Wilcox, reminded the courtroom of what Alexander and his \r\nfamily lost.\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to get married, he wanted a family,\" she said. \"I am married. I have a family, \r\na family he will never get to meet.\"\r\n\r\nStephens listened intently to both sides, then sentenced Arias to the harsher penalty.\r\nThe crime \"was especially cruel,\" the judge said. \"It involved substantial planning and preparation. ... \r\nThe defendant destroyed evidence ... and went to great lengths to conceal her involvement.\"\r\n\r\nShe said she saw no reason for leniency.\r\n\r\nArias probably will appeal her conviction, as her attorneys made a detailed record of their\r\n allegations of misconduct against prosecutor Juan Martinez over the course of two trials. \r\n And the criminal defense community, meanwhile, is assembling a dossier on Martinez with the \r\nintent \r\n of filing a complaint to the State Bar of Arizona regarding his conduct in the Arias case and \r\nothers.\r\nAlexander, 30, was found dead in the shower of his Mesa, Ariz., home in June 2008. \r\nHe had been shot in the head and stabbed nearly 30 times, and his throat had been slit.\r\n\r\nAlexander\'\'s friends immediately pointed to Arias as a likely suspect. \r\nAnd explicit photos recovered from a digital camera found in Alexander\'\'s washing machine \r\nshowed that the murder occurred after a tryst between Arias and Alexander.\r\n\r\nThey had photographed each other naked in bed, and Arias had photographed Alexander in the shower \r\nwhere he was found. \r\nOne photo even showed his bloody body lying on the floor.\r\nAfter a salacious trial that was live-streamed through cyberspace and regaled in social and \r\nmainstream media alike, \r\nArias was found guilty of first-degree murder. But the jury that convicted her was unable to reach \r\na unanimous \r\nverdict on whether to sentence her to death or to life in prison.\r\n\r\nA second jury was seated in October 2014 to again consider the life-or-death sentence. \r\nAlthough Stephens did not allow the retrial to be broadcast in any fashion, it still generated \r\nstrong emotion on social media outlets.\r\n\r\nThe retrial took almost as long as the first trial nearly five months and that jury ended in a \r\ndeadlock as well, \r\nwith a single holdout against the death penalty. Under state law, Arias cannot be tried again \r\nand must be sentenced to life in prison.\r\n\r\nThe holdout juror Juror 17 was subsequently outed on social media and harassed to the point of \r\nneeding police protection. \r\nThe jurors who voted for the death penalty accused Juror 17 of having an agenda.\r\n\r\nThe Maricopa County Attorney\'\'s Office is reportedly \"reviewing\" the juror\'\'s background and \r\nthe circumstances of how \r\nher identity was revealed moments after the \r\nmistrial was declared.\r\n','prison_sentence'),(4,'KPMG partner who gave tips to golf buddy sentenced for insider trading\r\nApril 24, 2014|By Stuart Pfeifer\r\nA former partner with accounting giant KPMG was sentenced to 14 months in federal prison for giving confidential information about his firm’s clients to a golfing buddy, who used it to make more than $1 million in profits trading stocks.\r\n\r\nScott London, 51, pleaded guilty to insider trading last year, admitting that he gave confidential information about KPMG clients, including Herbalife Ltd. and Skechers USA Inc., to his stock-trading friend several times from October 2010 to  May 2012.\r\n\r\nU.S. District Judge George Wu issued the sentence Thursday in Los Angeles. He also ordered London to pay a $100,000 fine. \r\n\r\nDefense attorney Harland Braun had argued for a sentence of 6 to 12 months, noting that his client had already paid dearly for his crime: losing his $900,000-a-year job, his reputation and a host of KPMG friends who are not permitted to talk to him.\r\nThe prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Atty. James A. Bowman, said three years was appropriate because of the significant violation of London’s duties to his clients and the damage it caused them. Herbalife and Skechers were required to hire new accounting firms and restate their earnings after learning of London’s actions.\r\n\r\nLondon benefited from the crimes. As a reward for the tips, London’s friend, Bryan Shaw, gave him thousands of dollars in cash, concert tickets and jewelry, including a Rolex watch, prosecutors said.\r\n\r\nLondon was a senior partner at KPMG in charge of the audit practice for clients in California, Arizona and Nevada. He also personally oversaw audits of Herbalife and Skechers.\r\n\r\nHe gave Shaw inside information at least 14 times, reading him news releases before they were issued, telling him about planned acquisitions and giving him advance word about company earnings, prosecutors said.\r\n\r\nThe tips enabled Shaw to make numerous profitable trades.\r\n\r\nShaw snapped up thousands of Herbalife shares in the weeks before a May 2011 announcement of the company\'s record sales, prosecutors said. The news drove Herbalife shares up 13%. Shaw sold his shares within days, netting about $450,000 in profit.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012, London told Shaw that KPMG client Pacific Capital Bancorp was about to be acquired by Union Bank, prosecutors said. Pacific Capital\'s shares soared 57% when the news was announced in March 2012. Shaw made $365,000.\r\n\r\nThe scheme unraveled after regulators became suspicious of Shaw’s well-timed trades. He later agreed to cooperate in an investigation of London, secretly recording their conversations and handing him an envelope stuffed with cash while FBI agents snapped photographs.\r\n\r\nShaw, who has also pleaded guilty, is scheduled to be sentenced May 19.\r\n\r\nIn April 2012, KPMG shocked the financial world by announcing it had fired London and withdrawn several past audits of Herbalife and Skechers. The criminal case was filed a few days later.\r\n\r\nLondon, in an interview with The Times, said he could not explain his actions.\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea what I was thinking,” he said shortly after he was fired. “I don\'t know why there was a lapse of judgment but there was.\"','prison_sentence'),(5,'Richard Nixon resigns after Watergate\r\nBy William Mullen\r\n\r\nThe botched 1972 burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington\'s Watergate complex \r\nled two years later to an unprecedented event in American history: the resignation, on this date, of a president.\r\n Republican Richard Nixon\'s tearful farewell to the nation had the earmarks of Greek tragedy. \r\n Having won his second term by the biggest landslide in history, Nixon was hounded from office by public outrage and \r\n the threat of impeachment.\r\nChicago and the Midwest had been strongholds of Nixon support as the drama of political shenanigans, intrigue, \r\ncover-up and betrayal unfolded. \r\nThat support dropped away after April 30, 1974. That was the day Nixon, forced by congressional pressure, \r\nreleased a 1,308-page transcript of edited Watergate-related conversations between him and his key aides.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transcript led the Tribune to publish one of the most extraordinary editions in newspaper history. \r\nThe Tribune was the only newspaper in the country that decided to print the entire, 246,000-word transcript \r\nthe next day. It was a herculean undertaking, marshaling the effort of hundreds of Tribune secretaries, office clerks, \r\nreporters, editors and printers to copy and typeset the text in a few hours in an era before the widespread use of \r\ncomputers. The 44-page special section was added to the 80-page Wednesday paper.\r\n\r\nTribune Editor Clayton Kirkpatrick, who spearheaded the effort, had long admired Nixon\'s political leadership. \r\nLike many Americans, however, the contents of the transcript changed Kirkpatrick\'s mind. He was a principal \r\nauthor of a devastating editorial on May 9, titled \"Listen, Mr. Nixon . . . \" It began: \"We saw the public man \r\nin his first administration, and we were impressed. Now in about 300,000 words we have seen the private man, and \r\nwe are appalled.\" The editorial called for Nixon to be impeached or to resign, citing the transcript\'s revelations \r\nof White House treachery and amorality. The loss of the staunchly Republican newspaper\'s support was particularly \r\ndisheartening to Nixon. It was a signal that middle America had abandoned him, helping to clear the path to his \r\nresignation.','resignationFromPost'),(6,'President resigns after riots leave 22 dead in Argentina\r\n\r\nPresident Fernando De la Rua resigned and fled the government palace in a helicopter, driven from office by a devastating economic crisis and days of rioting that left 22 people dead and homes and supermarkets across Argentina ransacked.\r\nDe la Rua\'s sudden downfall yesterday came amid Argentina\'s worst unrest in a decade. Screeching tear gas canisters arced across the capital and police fired rubber bullets at thousands of anti-government protesters in the runup to his fall.\r\nRioters looted houses and stores in other cities, and more than 200 people were injured nationwide.\r\n\"I\'m delighted he\'s finally gone. Thank God!\" said Maria Andrejuk, who was among those celebrating after tensions eased across much of Buenos Aires. But as night fell, some looting persisted.\r\nNow Argentina\'s faltering economy awaits the hands of a caretaker government led by the party founded by strongman Juan Peron in the 1940s. The Peronists take their turn at trying to tame a crisis that has left the country perilously close to defaulting on its $132 billion debt burden.\r\nSenate Leader Ramon Puerta was in line to take over today as interim president until a special legislative assembly decides whether to call new elections within months.\r\nDe La Rua was departing as one of the most unpopular leaders in Argentina\'s history, driven out by nationwide protests by thousands of Argentines fed up with his calls for more belt-tightening.\r\nIn working-class neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires province, hordes of teenagers ransacked grocery stores as outnumbered police stood by helplessly, while helmeted officers fired tear gas to disperse dozens of looters in a central Buenos Aires neighbourhood.\r\nEarlier in the day, the capital\'s streets looked like a battleground. Fires smouldered and smoke curled over the Plaza de Mayo outside the ornate pink government palace as thousands gathered to vent anger over the economy and call for De la Rua\'s ouster.\r\nBlack-clad officers swung truncheons, fired rubber bullets and aimed water cannons on the seething crowds of demonstrators. Many shirtless youths hurled sticks and cobblestones back at police lines. Scores of people, weeping from acrid tear gas, fled with rubber bullet wounds.\r\nAcross the nation, 22 people died, police said.\r\nProtesters called for De la Rua to step onto the balcony and face the people, shouting, \"Come out! Come out!\" The shutters stayed shut, and the palace was surrounded by iron barricades and scores of riot police.\r\nDe La Rua declared a state of siege late on Wednesday, assuming increased powers to quell the two days of unrest. Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo quit early yesterday, followed by reports that the entire Cabinet offered to resign.\r\nWith chaos on the streets, De la Rua made a final bid to hold onto his presidency, calling for the opposition to join a national unity government.\r\nRebuffed by opposition leaders, he tendered his resignation hours later in a handwritten letter.\r\nAs the sun set behind a haze of tear gas, De La Rua\'s helicopter lifted off from the government palace rooftop and took him to his suburban residence. The heliport hadn\'t been used by a departing leader since Isabel Peron was pushed out in a 1976 coup.\r\nThe collapse appeared to end a gruelling political crisis that began more than a year ago with the resignation De la Rua\'s vice president, Carlos Alvarez.\r\nDe La Rua took office in December 1999 with a popularity rating above 70 percent, a no-nonsense image and a pledge to improve the economy. But he soon became seen as indecisive, and left with ratings in single digits.\r\n\"I think he totally lacked direction and he clearly couldn\'t fix the economy,\" said Pablo Mario Alvarez, 50. \"I was excited when he first came to office, but that quickly faded.\"\r\nDiscontent with De La Rua was stoked by four years of bitter recession that exhausted the country and left it lurching close to default on its massive public debt.\r\nThough De la Rua technically remained president, media reports said Congress would accept De la Rua\'s resignation and appoint Puerta interim president in a session this morning.\r\nHe faces a tough job. Growth, production and business confidence are plummeting, and unemployment has topped 18 per cent.\r\nMany analysts now predict the new government will likely end the Argentine peso\'s one-to-one peg with the dollar, in place since 1991. While it helped Argentina vanquish hyperinflation more than a decade ago, today it is blamed for making Argentine exports uncompetitive abroad.\r\nAny devaluation of the peso could mean instant bankruptcy for thousands of Argentines, along with many of the country\'s largest businesses. More than 80 per cent of contracts and debts are denominated in the dollar.\r\nBefore De la Rua\'s resignation, a senior White House official said President George W. Bush\'s administration would wait for the dust to settle before deciding what, if any, action to take to help Argentina recover.\r\nThe official said limited direct financial assistance has not been completely ruled out, although the Bush administration still wants Argentina to resolve its problems through the International Monetary Fund.\r\nEarlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O\'Neill said the Bush administration, the IMF and the World Bank would continue working with Argentina to pull it back from the brink of economic collapse.\r\nBut he said the initiative to put Argentina on solid financial footing \"has to come from the leadership of the country. It\'s not something that can be imposed from outside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n','resignationFromPost'),(7,'Wendy\'s to sell 640 restaurants\r\nBen Rooney\r\nWendy\'s announced plans Wednesday to sell 640 of its company-owned restaurants in the United States and Canada.\r\nThe sales are a part of the burger chain\'s plan to reduce the number of company-owned locations.\r\nThe company hopes to sell the restaurants to franchisees. Wendy\'s stock rose 7% on the news.\r\nIt intends to sell 380 restaurants this year and another 260 in 2016. \r\nThe company is working with a private equity group to manage the sale,\r\n which will be directed at existing Wendy\'s franchise owners.\r\nAt the end of 2014, Wendy\'s had a total of 6,515 restaurants worldwide.\r\nCEO Emil Brolick said the goal is to \"drive further growth opportunities for \r\nexpanded restaurant ownership to strong operators.\" He expects the deal to generate up to $475 million in cash.\r\nWendy\'s (WENDY) is also selling its bakery in Zanesville, Ohio, where it makes buns.\r\nThe news came as Wendy\'s reported first-quarter financial results that topped Wall Street\'s expectations.\r\nThe company said sales rose 3.2% at both franchise and company owned stores. \r\nHowever, earnings fell 40% to $27.5 million, though it beat analysts\' estimates.','companyProdSale'),(8,'Seventy Seven Energy Inc.

Am I ready for this? If the answer is yes then we want to hear from you,\' said Lansdorp.\r\nThe time commitment to the project- successful candidates will have to undergo eight years of training before blast-off in 2023- has clearly not been an inhibiting factor so far.\r\nFormer NASA researcher Norbert Kraft, Mars One’s medical director, said: ‘Gone are the days when bravery and the number of hours flying a supersonic jet were the top criteria for selection.\r\n\'Now, we are more concerned with how well each astronaut works and lives with the others – and for a lifetime of challenges ahead.’\r\nMars One aims to raise money to help fund the project through a long-running, global, reality TV show, which will select the first 24 candidates and follow their training. \r\nViewers would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave Earth in ten years time.

When the market was soft, the group slashed production \r\nto raise prices.\r\n\r\nBut Saudi Arabia, the heavyweight of the Organization of the Petroleum \r\nExporting Countries, has a new agenda. It is now less concerned \r\nabout the price of crude oil in the global markets and more concerned \r\nabout delivering fuel to its growing economy.\r\n\r\nThe shift is upending the traditional market dynamics that have \r\ninfluenced the direction of oil prices for decades.\r\n\r\nWhile American producers are pulling back in the \r\nface of the current weak prices, Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer by far, \r\nhas been pumping more and more barrels. Saudi Arabia’s daily production \r\nin March and April nearly equaled its record output in 1980 when prices were soaring.\r\n\r\nThe country’s allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are also drilling at \r\nrecord rates, while Iraq is shrugging off widespread civil conflict to increase production. Even Iran is preparing plans to develop more oil fields.\r\nThe surging output has taken much of the mystery out of what the delegates of the \r\n12 OPEC countries will do when they assemble in Vienna this week to set production \r\nlevels for the next six months. They have already pushed the cartel’s output \r\n3 percent above the current target, and production appears to be heading even higher.\r\n\r\nThe acute pressure to cut production is also off. Oil prices, after a \r\nsharp drop over the last year, have stabilized somewhat at more than $60 a barrel.\r\n\r\n“No cut is coming,” said René G. Ortiz of Ecuador, a former secretary general of \r\nOPEC. “Each and every country, and particularly the Saudis and the other monarchies \r\nof the gulf, will protect their market share and increase their market share as much \r\nas possible.”\r\n\r\nFor decades, Saudi Arabia was the primary force that made OPEC the swing producer \r\nin global markets.\r\n\r\nAfter Saudi Arabia’s production peaked in 1980, it cut supplies later in the decade \r\nand again in the 1990s to prop up prices. The Saudis followed the same playbook \r\nwhen oil prices briefly sank during the 2008 global financial crisis and the\r\n economic slump the next year. When political turmoil rocked Libya, another \r\n producer, during the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia increased production to keep markets \r\n and its own revenue stable.\r\n\r\nNow, Saudi Arabia’s role — and the broader market — is evolving.','goodsPrices'),(14,'Signs of Higher Oil and Gas Prices as Stockpiles Dwindle\r\nHOUSTON — Oil and gasoline prices have been on a ferocious rebound over the last \r\nmonth, and there were signs on Wednesday that declining domestic inventories \r\ncould mean still higher prices as the summer driving season approaches.\r\n\r\nThe Energy Department reported on Wednesday that United States crude oil \r\nstockpiles fell last week for the first time since December, down by nearly \r\nfour million barrels.\r\nSeveral factors point to a continuing rise in American crude prices, \r\nwhich collapsed by roughly half between July and early January. These include \r\nrising refinery processing rates, declining imports and a flattening of \r\ndomestic crude production as companies decommission more drilling rigs.\r\n\r\nOil prices were volatile for the day, and the American West Texas Intermediate benchmark rose 32 cents a barrel to finish the trading day at $60.72 a barrel. The price, which rose above $60 for the first time this year earlier in the week, has risen by roughly 40 percent since late March.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nRELATED COVERAGE\r\n\r\nThe train fire near Heimdal, N.D.

The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline on Wednesday was $2.63, according to the AAA auto club, a full penny more than the day before. The average price is up nearly 25 cents a gallon over the last month, but still remains $1.04 lower per gallon than a year ago.\r\n\r\nThe steady rise in fuel prices buoyed the spirits of energy company executives, who cut investments in exploration and production by as much as 30 percent this year. Talk began to surface around the oil shale fields of Texas and North Dakota of bringing rigs idled over the last six months back on as profit margins improved.\r\n“We think we are going through a natural cycle,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, president and chief executive of GE Oil and Gas. “There should be an upward trend. With lower investments, over the next six months, supplies are going to be impacted. Demand continues to increase, and you’ll see a price that starts to drift upward.”\r\n\r\nThe government said the country was still producing nearly 9.4 million barrels a day, just a bit off multidecade highs. Commercial crude and refined product inventories remained well above normal.\r\nSome energy experts warned that the Energy Department might be underestimating American oil production and that the price of oil could dip again. They said that companies had drilled hundreds of wells but were waiting for higher prices before completing them for production.\r\n\r\nIn a note to investors on Wednesday, Citi Research warned that “higher prices could presage a production surge later this year as uncompleted wells are worked down and rig counts rise. Inventories could stay stubbornly high over the year, and refinery maintenance in the fall could drive large stock builds on an already high base.”\r\n\r\nA major reason for the slide in inventories was a weekly drop of nearly a million barrels a day in imports at a time when the trade balance had otherwise been deteriorating.\r\n\r\nAnother reason oil prices have risen is a return of risk to supplies abroad. With chaos spreading across Libya, protesters in recent days have closed one of the few major export ports that had still been open. Energy experts say up to a half million barrels of daily world supplies of crude are at risk in Libya. Continuing turmoil in Yemen also puts in potential jeopardy vital sea lanes for oil shipments.','goodsPrices'),(15,'\'Beautiful Mind\' mathematician John Nash killed in crash\r\n24 May 2015\r\n\r\nUS mathematician John Nash, who inspired the Oscar-winning film A Beautiful Mind, \r\nhas died in a car crash with his wife, police have said.\r\nNash, 86, and his 82-year-old wife Alicia were killed when their taxi crashed in New Jersey, \r\nthey said.\r\nThe mathematician is renowned for his work in game theory, winning the \r\nNobel Prize for Economics in 1994.\r\nHis breakthroughs in maths - and his struggles with schizophrenia - \r\nwere the focus of the 2001 film.\r\nRussell Crowe, who played him, tweeted: \"Stunned...

Still, the results beat analysts’ consensus forecasts.\r\n\r\nBut analysts said that there was cause for concern in Shell’s results.\r\nIn an indication of how quickly a drop in oil prices can erode margins, \r\nthe company said that its earnings from finding and producing oil and gas \r\nwere $675 million for the quarter, compared with $5.7 billion a year earlier.\r\nShell said that the price it received for oil in the first quarter was 52 percent\r\n lower than the same period in 2014, while the price of natural gas fell by \r\n 27 percent. The fall in prices directly cut $4.7 billion from earnings.\r\n“Cracks starting to show” was the language that Biraj Borkhataria, \r\nan analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, used in a note to clients on\r\n Thursday.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that profits in what Shell calls “integrated gas,”\r\n which mostly refers to liquefied natural gas, fell sharply to about $1.2 billion,\r\n compared with about $3.3 billion a year earlier. Liquefied natural \r\n gas has been an important earner for Shell and a big part of the calculus in \r\n its recent $70 billion bid for BG Group, which was once part of British Gas \r\n and is a major player in liquefied natural gas.\r\n\r\nShell continues to struggle in the Americas, where it lost $1.1 billion in \r\nthe quarter, in part because of low prices for shale gas in the United States \r\nas well as costly preparations for drilling in Alaska this summer. \r\nIt is preparing “a small armada” of ships including two drilling rigs for \r\nthis effort, Shell’s chief financial officer, Simon Henry, told reporters on \r\nThursday.\r\n\r\nRefining and marketing, as well as chemical sales, on the other hand, showed \r\nstrong improvement, together earning $2.6 billion, compared with about $1.6 \r\nbillion in the same period a year earlier. Shell said that refining profit \r\nmargins were better in all regions.\r\n\r\nIn recent months, refining, which has been a struggling business at most \r\nmajor oil companies because of oversupply, has improved because of lower \r\nprices for the crude oil used in the process and relatively strong demand.\r\nBen van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, said in a statement that “in what\r\n is clearly a difficult industry environment, we continue to take steps to \r\n further improve competitive performance.”\r\n\r\nMr. van Beurden said that Shell had sold about $2 billion worth of assets \r\nthis year that the company considered nonstrategic. These \r\nsales included onshore oil properties in Nigeria that are \r\nvulnerable to sabotage and oil theft. Shell also sold 185 gas stations \r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. van Beurden, who became chief executive at the beginning of last year, \r\nis trying to offload marginal assets like the Nigerian onshore fields and \r\nsome refining and marketing networks. He is focusing on Shell’s more profitable \r\nbusinesses like liquefied natural gas as well as exploration and production in \r\ndeep water in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIts most important move was its offer in April to buy BG, which would be Shell’s\r\n biggest deal ever, by far.\r\n\r\nBG should help Shell bolster its exploration and production unit by adding BG’s \r\nportfolio of discoveries and properties under development in Brazil, East Africa \r\nand elsewhere. Shell, in turn, would apply its much larger capital resources and \r\ndevelopment expertise to the combined company.\r\n\r\nBG also bolsters Shell’s leading position in the production and distribution of \r\nliquefied natural gas, although that business may struggle in the coming quarters \r\nbecause liquefied natural gas prices are linked to oil with a time lag of three\r\n to six months.\r\n','companyStockPrice'),(19,'Man taken to hospital after suffering self-inflicted injuries\r\nQUEENSBURY | Police surrounded a house on Caroline Street for more \r\nthan an hour Wednesday after a report that a man inside the home had threatened \r\nto harm himself. \r\n\r\nThe man was removed from the house shortly after 1 p.m., having suffered \r\nself-inflicted injuries, police said.

after two decades working through the intelligence history he was studying.\r\n\r\nAs a determined youngster Mr Gladwin rose from his first job as a grocery delivery boy to become a radio communications engineer with the Foreign Office and secret service.\r\nAs soon as he spotted the degree Mr Gladwin - who still sends Morse Code messages to friends across the world - knew it was perfect for him.\r\nImpressively, his masters is the third degree he has bagged since retiring 25 years go, after he completing a BA in Psychology and a BSc in Microbiology through the Open University.\r\nThe graduate, of Milton Keynes, Bucks, admitted today that he was a \'late bloomer\' and revealed he was even considering tackling on a PhD.\r\nMr Gladwin said: \'Most of what we handled isn\'t secret anymore of course, in fact I had to study some of it for my Masters.\r\n\r\n\'It was a strange feeling to be reading about history in a textbook that you lived through yourself.\r\n\'When I started I was worried about being up to the challenge but once I got\r\nthere I realised I could have been the most qualified person ever to do that\r\ncourse.\'\r\nHe added: \'At the start of the course I have to admit I was a little embarrassed at first, I didn\'t know what would be expected of me.\r\n\'On the first day I couldn\'t find the class so I was around 20 minutes late and had to creep in the back of the room\r\n\'You are never too old to learn, it\'s a pleasure to be able to carry on learning through your life and makes the experience all the more enjoyable.\r\n\'Of course our memories aren\'t as good as they once were but you can still keep up and participate.\r\n\'I found that my humour hadn\'t changed that much, even if I did seem a bit old-fashioned compared to my friends we had a lot of laughs.\'\r\n\r\n\'Going to university changed my whole attitude towards young people and I hope maybe I have shown them old people aren\'t too bad either.\'\r\nMr Gladwin graduated in March this year - just before his birthday, aged 90 - and was proudly watched by his wife Wendy, 79, who encouraged him to try university despite not even having A-levels.\r\nMost of Mr Gladwin\'s essays were inspired by the two decades working at Hanslope Park, Bucks, which famously became the successor to Bletchley Park for British Intelligence.\r\nHe completed his final thesis on the role of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in France during the Second World War, and gained a distinction.\r\nHis proud graduation came after he started earned just 14 shillings a week (60p) when in his first job delivering groceries in Dulwich, London.\r\n\r\nHe later switched to work as a barrister\'s clerk before signing up for the RAF aged 19, to fight in World War Two.\r\nMr Gladwin, who had been interested in radios since he was nine, was assigned to the Signallers and dispatched to the Middle East for the remainder of the war.\r\nWhile he was posted in the desert he stumbled across the complete works of Freud in a military camp library and his 60 year interest in psychology.\r\nWhen Mr Gladwin returned to Britain he became a flight radio officer on commercial planes, before being signed up by the Foreign Office to maintain MI6 communication links across the world.\r\n\r\nHe said: \'When I retired I became less active and thought that going back to my studies would delay the onset of senility.\r\n\'I wanted to keep my brain active and learn more about something that had always interested me.\'\r\nMr Gladwin completed his first degree, a BA in psychology from the Open University in his mid sixties and followed it up with a BSc in Molecular biology which he finished in just two years, as he turned 70.\r\nHe took the British record for senior studying from the previous 89-year-old title holder.\r\nThe current world record is currently held by a 96-year-old philosophy graduate from China.\r\n\r\n','personGraduate');
