American Approved for Los Angeles-Mexico Trips After Delta Balks
by Mary Schlangenstein
American Airlines won tentative approval to begin flying between Los Angeles and Mexico City as 
U.S. regulators dismissed objections to the plan by Delta Air Lines.
The route can be operated by American for a year, the U.S. Department of Transportation 
said Friday in backing the shift of the flight authority from Alaska Airlines. The agency 
said it would consider objections to the decision in the interim, or make the ruling final 
if there is no opposition.
The exchange between Fort Worth, Texas-based American and Alaska lets the world's largest 
airline start flights from its Los Angeles hub to Mexico City and offer the route twice daily. 
Delta filed documents to block the swap and urged the government to allow other carriers to bid 
for the flying rights.
American's victory in building up its Los Angeles service follows a setback in late March, 
when U.S. regulators rebuffed the airline's attempt to take some of Delta's authority to 
serve Tokyo's Haneda airport. American wanted Haneda access to begin flying there from Los Angeles.
Under a U.S.-Mexico treaty, Alaska and United Airlines are the only U.S. carriers allowed 
to fly between Los Angeles and the Mexican capital. Alaska, which operates the flight once a 
day, will be able to book its customers on the Mexico flights through a marketing agreement 
with American.
